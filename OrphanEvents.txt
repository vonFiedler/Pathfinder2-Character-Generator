0*003*014*Another orphan has challenged you for your small bit of turf.
ANY*00*-1*-1*I throw them out of my territory, physically.
ANY*00*-1*-1*I challenge them to a fist fight.
ANY*01*-1*-1*I pants them in front of a group of other kids.
ANY*01*-1*-1*Trouble? I'm getting out of here!
ANY*02*-1*-1*Pfff. What can they do to me?
ANY*02*-1*-1*I challenge them to a drinking contest.
ANY*03*-1*-1*They think they can take what is mine? Then the game is on.
ANY*03*-1*-1*I plan something devious to scare them away.
ANY*04*-1*-1*If they think one corner of a massive city is worth anything, they can have it.
ANY*04*-1*-1*I pray for deliverance from this trial.
ANY*05*-1*-1*We could conquer this whole city if we worked together.
ANY*05*-1*-1*I convince them that they would be better off trying elsewhere.

0*017*028*Another day, another copper. How do you plan to survive on the streets?
ANY*00*-1*-1*I hear there is a monster in the sewers. I'm gonna fight it and eat it.
ANY*00*-1*-1*I beat up a townie kid up and steal their copper.
ANY*01*-1*-1*I pick some pockets.
ANY*01*-1*-1*I grab any food I can and make a run for it.
ANY*02*-1*-1*I scrounge food out of the garbage.
ANY*02*-1*-1*I look for any menial labor, even though the wage will be small.
ANY*03*-1*-1*I'm never going to survive in the long run if I don't teach myself to read.
ANY*03*-1*-1*I imagine a bank heist I might pull if I was a bit older.
ANY*04*-1*-1*I beg for food at the local mission, knowing I'll be preached at in exchange.
ANY*04*-1*-1*I scrounge under tables for lost copper.
ANY*05*-1*-1*I find a crowd and beg for copper.
ANY*05*-1*-1*I try to befriend a local kid with money.

0*031*042*The local slum lord likes to know everyone living on their streets. How do you impress them?
ANY*00*-1*-1*I challenge them to a fight so that I may replace them.
ANY*00*-1*-1*I lift the biggest thing I can find, hoping that they're looking to hire some muscle.
ANY*01*-1*-1*I'd rather escape their notice to be honest.
ANY*01*-1*-1*I try to lift something off of them and then show them what I did.
ANY*02*-1*-1*I only want them to think of me as a hard worker.
ANY*02*-1*-1*I've lived this long on my own. I don't need their approval.
ANY*03*-1*-1*I show off my self-education, a rare asset on the streets.
ANY*03*-1*-1*I try to explain a way they could improve their "business".
ANY*04*-1*-1*I use the opportunity to learn from them.
ANY*04*-1*-1*I don't much approve of their morals, so I take the time to proselytize.
ANY*05*-1*-1*I just talk to them and try to build a rapport.
ANY*05*-1*-1*I'm the most impressive orphan in the world, or so they'll think after I build myself up.

0*045*056*At one point you are rounded up and placed into a state-run orphanage. Though it doesn't last forever, what do you do during your time there?
ANY*00*-1*-1*With ample food, I use the opportunity to build up some muscle.
ANY*00*-1*-1*Angered by my captivity, I start fights.
ANY*01*-1*-1*This is not comfortable for me. I sneak out as soon as possible.
ANY*01*-1*-1*I join a group of other orphans playing with slingshots.
ANY*02*-1*-1*With ample food, I do sit-ups and crunches to build up my physical resistance.
ANY*02*-1*-1*I help out around the orphanage, hoping I can get referred to an apprenticeship somewhere.
ANY*03*-1*-1*I read every book that comes through those doors.
ANY*03*-1*-1*I try to learn a new thing to increase my prospects.
ANY*04*-1*-1*I ask the nuns about their god.
ANY*04*-1*-1*I'm content for the first time in my life, knowing that this is a big step up from the hole I was living in.
ANY*05*-1*-1*Finally, a bunch of kids my own age to get along with.
ANY*05*-1*-1*I bully the other kids, hoping to start a gang of my own.

1*059*067*After a day without eating, you are walking down the street when you see a loaf of bread cooling on a window sill.
ANY*06*10*-1*I find the people who live there and beg them for a bite to eat.
ANY*06*-1*-1*I eat half of the bread, but throw a copper through the window the next time I can find one.
ANY*06*12*-1*I run off with the loaf, as I know a few other orphans who need it just as much as I do.
ANY*10*-1*-1*I tighten my belt. Hunger is better than jail.
ANY*-1*-1*-1*I'm going for it!
ANY*12*-1*-1*Their loss is my luck.
ANY*08*10*-1*I walk on in resentment. When I'm so fortunate, I wouldn't be such a fool as them.
ANY*08*-1*-1*I'll keep watch on this house and wait for the opportunity to steal a lot more than one loaf of bread.
ANY*08*12*-1*I chuck it into the mud. If I can't eat, no one can.

1*070*078*You see a middle class family walking down the street. They seem happy.
ANY*06*10*-1*Someday I'm going to start a family like that.
ANY*06*-1*-1*Instead of being sad, I'm reminded that there is hope in the world.
ANY*06*12*-1*I take my chances and try to start a new friendship.
ANY*10*-1*-1*This is how the world functions. Some have a lot and some don't.
ANY*-1*-1*-1*It is what it is.
ANY*12*-1*-1*I actually like not having anyone to tell me what to do.
ANY*08*10*-1*I'll be the one standing over them someday.
ANY*08*-1*-1*I hate normies like that.
ANY*08*12*-1*What do they think they're doing in crime alley? I chuck a rock at them.

1*081*089*A man grabs you, covers your mouth, and takes you aside into an alleyway. "You have to hide me," he says.
ANY*06*10*-1*I cooperate, but at the first opportunity find a guard to alert. This city has too many scoundrels as is.
ANY*06*-1*-1*If he's in desparate need, it doesn't matter to me what he's done. Perhaps genuine kindness can mend his ways.
ANY*06*12*-1*I'll protect this man from any ne'er-do-wells that are after him!
ANY*10*-1*-1*I don't want to be implicated in this, so I alert the guard as soon as possible.
ANY*-1*-1*-1*I'll just do what he says so that I don't get hurt.
ANY*12*-1*-1*This is far too interesting not to go along with.
ANY*08*10*-1*I feign friendship, but look to see if he has a bounty I can claim later.
ANY*08*-1*-1*His problems are his own. I kick him in the knee and run.
ANY*08*12*-1*I help, but I want in on whatever his racket is.

1*092*100*A wealthy looking child has wandered into an alley you are in.
ANY*06*10*-1*I quickly turn them around and explain in detail what a dangerous place this is.
ANY*06*-1*-1*They must be looking for a friend!
ANY*06*12*-1*They must be trying to escape their stuffy upper class life. This sounds like the start of a mutual adventure.
ANY*10*-1*-1*This is a recipe for disaster. I want no part of it.
ANY*-1*-1*-1*I watch and see what happens.
ANY*12*-1*-1*I shake them down for anything of value. Nothing personal.
ANY*08*10*-1*I "protect" them, hoping to toady up to them and gain a powerful friend.
ANY*08*-1*-1*I beat them up and take their stuff. Serves them right for their naivety.
ANY*08*12*-1*Time for a lesson in pain. They'll never come down my neck of the woods again.

2*103*119*You have found a comfortable amount of food and shelter for now, but you're smart enough to know that you'll never better your situation without training to better yourself.
ANY*16*-1*-1*The guard will never catch me if I learn to tumble and squeeze.
ANY*17*-1*-1*Maybe I can learn to cast spells someday if I try to understand as much arcane literature as I can find.
ANY*18*-1*-1*I need to be tougher. If I have the extra food, I can go running each day.
ANY*19*-1*-1*There's always an abundance of scrap to tinker with.
ANY*20*-1*-1*I can always find a meal with the right con.
ANY*21*-1*-1*I need to learn to make friends in higher places.
ANY*22*-1*-1*I can always bully people into getting what I need.
ANY*23*-1*-1*Information trade is everything on the streets. I'll learn whatever I can.
ANY*24*-1*-1*It'd be nice to not die of the plague. I should learn about that.
ANY*25*-1*-1*The city is a fool's game. I'll be hitting the outdoors as soon as I'm strong enough.
ANY*26*-1*-1*The only ones with real power are the secret forces hiding behind society, and I'm going to find out how to contact them.
ANY*27*-1*-1*You can always make a few copper in crowds by putting on a show.
ANY*28*-1*-1*The clergy are the ultimate beggars. I'm going to figure them out.
ANY*29*-1*-1*I'm going to conquer this class system by learning as much as I can about it.
ANY*30*-1*-1*I'll be happy just staying out notice and trouble.
ANY*31*-1*-1*I'll make due surviving in this city even if I have to figure out what garbage to eat.
ANY*32*-1*-1*I'm just going to get better at stealing to get by.

122*133*There has to be more to life than this. How do you try to improve your station?
ANY*Acolyte*A local temple takes in beggers. I'll devote myself to their god if it means a regular meal.
ANY*Martial Disciple*A local temple takes in beggers. I'll devote myself to protecting them if it means a regular meal.
ANY*Charlatan*I'm going to fake it until I make it, scamming fools out of their less deserved gold.
ANY*Criminal*Crime is the only possible path to success for us. I'm going to do what I have to.
ANY*Street Urchin*On second thought, this way of life is pretty good.
ANY*Barkeep*A local tavern is looking for help. Maybe they will lower their expectations and hire me.
ANY*Laborer*Now that I'm older, I'm going to look for any petty work I can find.
NAT*Animal Whisperer*The city is too devoid of life. I want to run away and live with the animals.
NAT*Herbalist*With what I know now, I could survive much easier off of plants outside the city.
NAT*Hermit*I hate these people! I'm leaving the city and never coming back.
NAT*Nomad*I have no future here. I will travel to find it.
ANY*Warrior*I may not be patriotic and the draft board may not be looking for me, but there's little better option than to join the military.
